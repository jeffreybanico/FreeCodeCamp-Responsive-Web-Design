# Responsive Web Design
>As a beginner in the world of programming, I began with FreeCodeCamp.com's basic course, Responsive Web Pages using HTML and CSS, in which I was tasked with creating Responsive Web Pages. In this project, I learned the fundamentals and basics of HTML and CSS, as well as their importance in the field of web development. All of the copies of the projects that I've done throughout this course are all uploaded to Codepen.io are available at the link below.
